# Inner class challenge

*Working off of the playlist challenge code.*

Modify the Album class to use an inner class. Instead of using an `ArrayList` to hold its tracks, it will use an inner class called `SongList`.
The inner `SongList` class will use an `ArrayList` and include a method to add a song, as well as `findSong()` methods which will be
used by the containing `Album` class to add songs to the playlist.

Do not change any other classes.
